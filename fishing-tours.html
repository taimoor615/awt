                            <p>The Multi River/Day Fishing Trip works best originating from Jackson, WY as a majority of our float options are convenient to Jackson, WY.  We are happy to pick you up at your place of lodging anywhere in Jackson, Teton Village, or Yellowstone National Park.   If you are staying in an alternate location we may be able to  make arrangements to suit your travel plans. Please follow this link to purchase a fishing license online before the trip.

                            <p>Depending on ability and client preference we will start our multiple days of fishing on either the Snake, Green, or Salt rivers.  Some rivers lend themselves more to the novice angler and it may be a good idea to start on a less technical river such as the Snake if we need to work on our basic fishing techniques before we head off to a more challenging piece of water such as the Green, or the Salt River.  For our clients staying within Yellowstone National Park we will have numerous convenient wade fishing options as well.  Complete fishing itinerary will be developed through input from our clientâ€™s particular preferences and desired waters.</p>
                            <p>Please feel free to bring any equipment that you like but we will have anything you will need.  Fly selection will also be handled by your guide, allowing us to depart for our chosen waters shortly after making our introductions.</p>
                            <p>Upon arrival at our fishing destination we generally go over some basic safety and gear protocols, as well as a remedial skills instruction session if needed.  After reviewing some basic fly fishing theory we are off and fishing!</p>
                            <p>This is a really great opportunity to see more than one of our area waters and to get into some really great fish.</p>

                            <p>We are happy to pick you up at your place of lodging anywhere in Jackson or Teton Village for your full day fishing trip, and generally we will head straight to the river, making a stop for fishing licenses on the way if need be. Please follow this link to purchase a fishing license online before the trip.<a href="https://wgfd.wyo.gov/apply-or-buy">https://wgfd.wyo.gov/apply-or-buy</a>.</p>
                            <p>The Snake River is a relatively high volume, very braided river flowing out of Yellowstone Park, through Grand Teton,  and continuing south through the heart of Jackson Hole.  The native Fine Spotted Snake River Cutthroat is the name of the game, as they are happy to come to the surface for our dry fly patterns.  Cutthroat are also quite willing to strike streamers and spin cast lures as well.</p>
                            <p>Your guide will provide all equipment necessary for the day.  Rods, reels, flies, leader, lures, etc. Please bring your favorite rod and reel if you like, and any other equipment as well.  We generally will use 5 or 6 wt, 9 foot fly rods on the Snake river.</p>
                            <p>All of our half day trips are offered in a float fishing format, two anglers and guide per drift-boat.  We do have the option of adding a third angler for an additional charge.  Our drift-boats are equipped with a casting station and captains chairs front and back, with the guide situated in the middle, allowing anglers to stand and fish, or sit and fish as the guide maneuvers the boat.</p>
                            <p>Our half day fishing float will travel about 7 miles on the Snake River.</p>
                            <p>Your guide will generally start the day with an on river casting and or skills review session if needed, and then we are off and fishing.  Anglers will fish as the boat drifts under direction of your guide, with limited wading opportunities as time is limited.</p>
                            <p>Our day will wrap up in the early afternoon,  usually back to your lodging by 1:30pm, plan on a late lunch upon your return.  We practice catch and release so plan on bringing back some great photos and unforgettable memories.</p>

                            <p>Throughout the day your guide will navigate the boat, take care of fly selection and basic skills coaching as you travel the 13 miles of fantastic trout water that is the Snake River. You will fish from the boat, as well as the opportunity to wade fish a few of the runs as well.</p>
                            <p>Cutthroat Trout are famous for coming to the surface for your dry flies, but are also happy to strike a streamer, wet fly, and spin cast lures as well.</p>
                            <p>We will have all equipment necessary, but please feel free to bring any appropriate equipment that you would like. We also will include a delicious stream side picnic lunch as well.</p>

                            <p>Departure time to the river will be 7:30am.</p>
                            <p>A short 15 minute drive will bring us to our departure point, the Wilson Landing, just south of Grand Teton Park.</p>
                            <p>Some boat preparation will ensue, as well as the donning of lifejackets, and after an initial safety talk we will board the raft. Guests will be seated on the outside pontoons and cross tubes of the raft, with all navigation and propulsion handled by your guide, via a center mounted oar frame.</p>
                            <p>We will shove off and embark on a two hour, thirteen mile float down the Snake River as our friendly and professional guides share their knowledge of the history, geology, flora, and fauna of this amazing river system. We will have the breathtaking Teton Range as a backdrop for most of the float, as well as the Snake River Range, the Gros Ventre, and Hoback Ranges as well. Keep your eyes peeled as moose sightings are common, as well as elk and deer. I always guarantee a bald eagle or two, as we have over half a dozen nesting pairs on this beautiful stretch of river, not to mention close up views of active eagle nests as well.</p>
                            <p>We will complete our adventure at Von Gontardâ€™s landing, about 15 minutes south of Jackson. Weâ€™ll see you on the river!</p>

                            <p>The Multi River/Day Fishing Trip works best originating from Jackson, WY as a majority of our float options are convenient to Jackson, WY.  We are happy to pick you up at your place of lodging anywhere in Jackson, Teton Village, or Yellowstone National Park.   If you are staying in an alternate location we may be able to  make arrangements to suit your travel plans. Please follow this link to purchase a fishing license online before the trip.

                            <p>Depending on ability and client preference we will start our multiple days of fishing on either the Snake, Green, or Salt rivers.  Some rivers lend themselves more to the novice angler and it may be a good idea to start on a less technical river such as the Snake if we need to work on our basic fishing techniques before we head off to a more challenging piece of water such as the Green, or the Salt River.  For our clients staying within Yellowstone National Park we will have numerous convenient wade fishing options as well.  Complete fishing itinerary will be developed through input from our clientâ€™s particular preferences and desired waters.</p>
                            <p>Please feel free to bring any equipment that you like but we will have anything you will need.  Fly selection will also be handled by your guide, allowing us to depart for our chosen waters shortly after making our introductions.</p>
                            <p>Upon arrival at our fishing destination we generally go over some basic safety and gear protocols, as well as a remedial skills instruction session if needed.  After reviewing some basic fly fishing theory we are off and fishing!</p>
                            <p>This is a really great opportunity to see more than one of our area waters and to get into some really great fish.</p>

                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>We are happy to pick you up at your place of lodging anywhere in Jackson or Teton Village for your full day fishing trip, and generally we will head straight to the river, making a stop for fishing licenses on the way if need be. Please follow this link to purchase a fishing license online before the trip.<a href="https://wgfd.wyo.gov/apply-or-buy">https://wgfd.wyo.gov/apply-or-buy</a>.</p>
                            <p>The Snake River is a relatively high volume, very braided river flowing out of Yellowstone Park, through Grand Teton,  and continuing south through the heart of Jackson Hole.  The native Fine Spotted Snake River Cutthroat is the name of the game, as they are happy to come to the surface for our dry fly patterns.  Cutthroat are also quite willing to strike streamers and spin cast lures as well.</p>
                            <p>Your guide will provide all equipment necessary for the day.  Rods, reels, flies, leader, lures, etc. Please bring your favorite rod and reel if you like, and any other equipment as well.  We generally will use 5 or 6 wt, 9 foot fly rods on the Snake river.</p>
                            <p>All of our half day trips are offered in a float fishing format, two anglers and guide per drift-boat.  We do have the option of adding a third angler for an additional charge.  Our drift-boats are equipped with a casting station and captains chairs front and back, with the guide situated in the middle, allowing anglers to stand and fish, or sit and fish as the guide maneuvers the boat.</p>
                            <p>Our half day fishing float will travel about 7 miles on the Snake River.</p>
                            <p>Your guide will generally start the day with an on river casting and or skills review session if needed, and then we are off and fishing.  Anglers will fish as the boat drifts under direction of your guide, with limited wading opportunities as time is limited.</p>
                            <p>Our day will wrap up in the early afternoon,  usually back to your lodging by 1:30pm, plan on a late lunch upon your return.  We practice catch and release so plan on bringing back some great photos and unforgettable memories.</p>

                            <p>We will spend our day on the Snake River just outside of Jackson, WY. We will fish 13 miles of braided river with the Fine Spotted Cutthroat trout as our objective, but also with the possibility of picking up a few Mountain Whitefish as well.</p>
                            <p>We generally like to put on the water right away, and will pull into the first convenient eddy for a basic skills review and fishing theory review. After that we are ready to fish!</p>
                            <p>Throughout the day your guide will navigate the boat, take care of fly selection and basic skills coaching as you travel the 13 miles of fantastic trout water that is the Snake River. You will fish from the boat, as well as the opportunity to wade fish a few of the runs as well.</p>
                            <p>Cutthroat Trout are famous for coming to the surface for your dry flies, but are also happy to strike a streamer, wet fly, and spin cast lures as well.</p>
                            <p>We will have all equipment necessary, but please feel free to bring any appropriate equipment that you would like. We also will include a delicious stream side picnic lunch as well.</p>
